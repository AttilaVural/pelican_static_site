This is why I choose jekyll over pelican:

Pelican has no inbuilt support for Mermaid charts. i need to import the mermaid.js file inside a script tag and then enclose the mermaid chart inside a div tag.

Jekyll has inbuilt support for Mermaid charts. Jekyll is inbuilt into github pages, meaning I don't need to compile on my local pc and then push it to my github repo. I do need to create the initial site with the CLI, but after pushing it to my repo, adding new posts can be done inside the github web interface.
